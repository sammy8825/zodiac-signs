    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p class="info">The zodiac sign of Cancer originates from the cancer constellation. The cancer constellation lies in
        the Northern Hemisphere, with a right ascension of about 9 hours and a north declination of 20°. The cancer
        constellation is known for "the Beehive Cluster" which is a swarm of over 1,000 stars. The word cancer means
        "crab" in Latin. When you look up at the sky to find the constellation, you will only see an upside down "Y",
        however, it is said to symbolize a crab, hence the name. In astrology, the symbol for the zodiac sign Cancer
        is also a crab.</p>
